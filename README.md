# Sidir Alfred Workflow
This is an [Alfred v2](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow to allow you to easily work with the applications installed in your iOS simulator.

#Usage

To get started type "sidir"

![Image Alt](https://raw.github.com/paulsamuels/sidir-alfred-workflow/master/screenshot.png)

You can quickly browse straight to the sandbox for an application or delete it.

This workflow abstracts the pain of browsing the simulator directory. The simulator directory stores apps under a UUID making it hard to tell which application is which without navigating in and out of folders.

There are two operations on the selected item:

1. Open Finder at the selected application sandbox (default)
2. Remove the selected application (holding "alt" key)

# Installation

1. Download and unpack the .zip archive.
2. Double-click the "sidir.alfredworkflow" to install.

#Useless info

sidir is an abbreviation of Simulator Directory. This was originally a command line tool, which can still be installed with `gem install sidir`

#Licence
Sidir is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
